          <blockquote><b>Polyethylene Insects Series</b><br>
          <span>The prompt I was given in the creation of this series was "1,000 pieces."
          When brainstorming materials I could use to fulfill this prompt, I wanted to use an everyday accessible item to create my piece.
          I strove to use an everday item both to give it more mass appeal to my audience, and to make sure I wasn't breaking my college student budget.
          Plastic cutlery fufilled both of these requirements.
          Inspired by an artist I follow on Youtube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BobbyDukeArts">Bobby Duke Arts</a>, I decided to make a slew of bugs out of plastic cutlery.
          In this series, I created plastic facsimiles of a spider, wasp, cicada, grasshopper, and a butterfly.
          On display on this site are images of the wasp and spider from this series.
          For a look at these two art pieces, go to the "Artwork" tab.</span></blockquote>

          <blockquote><b>Hand Tree</b><br>
          <span>For this piece, the prompt was to take a found object, combine it with sculpted additions, and cast the completed from in plaster.
          Along with this process, we were also tasked with creating a metal stand through a combination of welding, grinding, and plasma cutting.
          The found object I chose to utilize was an acorn I collected from my college campus.
          As my college, Northwest Missouri State University, is an arboretum, I am constantly surrounded by trees and foliage.
          This constant influence of nature around me gave me the idea to theme my project around the influence of humanity on nature.
          Humans have genetically engineered crops and nature for millenium.
          This gave me the idea to take the form of the highly human influneced bonsai tree and combine it with my found object acorn.
          My vision was to warp the form of a human hand and its components in the same way humanity has warped nature.</span></blockquote>

          <blockquote><b>For my Father</b><br>
          <span>The prompt for this piece was to make what I would describe as a 3-dimensional wire drawing of an object.
          When brainstorming objects I could create in this fashion, I was reminded of childhood memories as I walked into my garage.
          When I was younger, and the lots surrounding my house were still empty, my father used to fly RC planes.
          Flying RC planes was a  favorite hobby of his, and I can recall many a time where my father loaded us into the car and drove us down to the nearest RC plane range.
          Upon reminiscing on these memories, I decided to make the subject of my piece one of my dad's beloved RC planes.
          Thus, "For my Father" is a tribute not only to my father, but the many fun memories of times spent together flying planes and paling around.</span></blockquote>

          <blockquote><b>Plaster Heart</b><br>
          <span>For this piece, I was tasked with using the medium of plaster to chisel and carve a sculptural form.
          My idea for this sculpture was to make the form of an abstracted heart.
          In my opinion, the heart has a very satisfying structure and flow throughout its form.
          In chiseling this sculpture out of plaster, I was seeking to remove the more gore-ish aspects of the heart.
          In this pursuit, I was hoping to showcase the satisfying image of the heart, devoid of all its connotations to bring a greater appreciation to the heart's form.</span></blockquote>
